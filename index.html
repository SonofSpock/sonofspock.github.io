    Greetings visitors,
</p>

<p>
    I'm happy you've decided to visit. Unfortunately, there isn't
    very much here for you yet; I am still trying to assemble the
    main components of the site. As you can tell from the URL, the
    site it hosted on <a href="https://www.bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>.
    Anyone can create a static site using their service, and hosting
    is free. This is what I have done. Building a site by hand is a
    tedious process, and it is even more so for someone who is new
    to web development, like me. So there probably won't be anything
    substantial for a few more weeks, but you are obviously free to
    keep checking if you like.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,<br>
    JPH<br>
