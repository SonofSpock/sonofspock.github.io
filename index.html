            I'm currently working as a data analyst at <a href="https://skyfactor.com/">Skyfactor</a>. I did my 
            undergraduate and graduate studies at
            the University of South Carolina, completing a master's degree in Higher Education in 2017. 
            Most of my work deals with sales and operations data at this point, but I also work with survey data. 
            I probably spend about sixty percent of my time extracting, transforming, and cleaning datasets. I love to automate
            that stuff if I can. The other forty percent is spent on exploration, inferential statistics, modeling, and creating
            dashboards and other reports.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent:24px; line-height:1.4em;">
            I'm always looking for ways to improve workflows and documentation. I use Python and the scientific 
            Python stack for most things, but I am also comfortable with R. Since most
            of our data is stored in relational databases, I also spend a fair amount of time in SQL. Recently, I've 
            taken an interest in web development, and I've been tackling JavaScript in my spare time. I'm obsessed with 
            logic, mathematics, philosophy, language, and computers. Here are some of my favorite quotes:

            <p><em>"If I have seen further than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."</em> -Sir Issac Newton</p>
