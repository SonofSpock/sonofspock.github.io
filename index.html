            I currently live and work in Charlotte, North Carolina as a software developer for
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/signature-consultants/">Signature
            Consultants</a>, a recruiting and staffing firm in the IT sector. Since August 2020, I've
            been on assignment with one of their clients in the banking industry. I design, code,
            test, and debug server-side applications for Linux environments. Unlike many other
            developers, I have had no formal education in computer science or software
            engineering; I'm self-taught.
          </p>
          <p class="jh-article-paragraph">
            I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of South Carolina. In 2015,
            I completed my bachelor's degree with a double major in Philosophy and Classics. At that
            time, I was obsessed with logic, ancient physics, and philology. In 2017, I
            completed my master's degree in Higher Education. As a graduate student, I was very
            interested in the social sciences&mdash;psychology, sociology, economics, and the law&mdash;and
            I used my electives to take courses in statistics. I also held an assistantship with the
            university's housing department for the duration of the degree which introduced me to
            data management and relational databases.
          </p>
          <p class="jh-article-paragraph">
            Instead of entering higher education administration after graduate school like most of my
            cohort, I leveraged the skills I had gained in data analytics and accepted a position at
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ebi-map-works/">Skyfactor</a> in Springfield,
            Missouri. By the time I started in June 2017 with the Analytics and Research Team (ART),
            I had already taught myself enough to be fairly compentent in R and SQL, and my director
            was keen to see me develop those skills further by adding Python to my repertoire. I held
            that position for two years.  During that time I rewrote the desktop application used by
            ART to run Monte Carlo simulations and build predictive models for student success. I
            also built a couple of console applications to automate some annoyingly tedious aspects
            of our production process and wrangle data for our operations and finance team.
          </p>
          <p class="jh-article-paragraph">
            In June 2019, I accepted a position at
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dealcloud-inc-/">DealCloud</a> in Charlotte,
            North Carolina, again as a data analyst. I hated the winters in the midwest, and having
            been raised in the Carolinas I was happy to move back home. I was also excited about the
            opportunity because, unlike my first job which had at least something to do with my
            graduate degree in terms of the industry and the subject matter, DealCloud served the
            financial services industry exclusively. I was hired specifically because of the
            technical skills I had managed to teach myself up to that point, and I was proud of that.
            I had two full years of experience with Python under my belt, and even though I preferred
            R for a long time, that had certainly changed by then.
          </p>
          <p class="jh-article-paragraph">
            At DealCloud, my work dealt with migrating new clients' data from their old solution
            into their instance of our app. After 6 months of working on data migrations, I
            transitioned into my first official software developer role on the Technical Services
            team where my focus shifted away from any one specific client's migration to developing
            solutions that could help with all migrations. I worked on my first full stack
            application there: a Flask app with a SQLite database and a React frontend. It had been
            designed and built by another developer who had left the company a few months before I
            arrived. It used a Celery task queue to process data asynchronously and ran on Ubuntu. I
            was responsible for designing and developing fixes and enhancements, and because it was a
            small project I also managed the environments on the server, built it, and deployed it.
            So in addition to SQL, R, and Python, I added Bash and the frontend dev stack&mdash;HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript&mdash;to my skillset.
          </p>
          <p class="jh-article-paragraph">
            In August 2020, I moved into my current role with Signature. Python is still my preferred
            language, and although I can do both, I enjoy server-side work much more than
            client-side. I'm love logic, mathematics, philosophy, philology, physics, and computers.
            I also still have a heart for education, and I hope that one day my career will lead
            back to that field. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started playing and and studying
            chess, which has been strangely therapeutic. I enjoy road cycling, hiking, and
            backpacking in the Great Smoky Mountains. I also love music; I have been known to strum
            the guitar and sing from time to time. Here are some of my favorite quotes:
