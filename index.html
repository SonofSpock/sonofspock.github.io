            I'm currently working as a software developer at <a href="https://dealcloud.com/">DealCloud</a>
            on the Technical Services team. My work primarily deals with the data migration process for our
            clients as they transition from their current data solution to the DealCloud CRM. Each migration
            is unique, and so each solution has its own implementation. But to help with some mundane data
            processing tasks, we have an internal web application known as the Data Tools for which I am
            primarily responsible. It is a full-stack solution built with Flask and ReactJS. Data processes
            are managed by an asynchronous task queue with Celery and Redis.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent:24px; line-height:1.4em;">
            Prior to DealCloud, I worked for <a href="https://skyfactor.com/">Skyfactor</a> from 2017 to 2019
            as a data analyst. In that role I was primarily responsible for developing statistical models of student
            retention. I also developed some internal applications to automate aspects of our production
            process, and provided insights to our operations team with Tableau.

            I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of South Carolina. In 2015, I
            completed my bachelor's degree with a double major in Philosophy and Classics. At that time I was
            mainly interested in symbolic logic and mathematics in Ancient Greece and Classical Rome. In
            2017, I completed my master's degree in Higher Education. As a graduate student I was very
            interested in the social sciences--psychology, sociology, economics, and the law. I held an
            assistantship with the university for the duration of the degree and a research position for
            part of the time as well.

            I'm always looking for ways to improve workflows and documentation. Python is my preferred
            language. The overwhelming majority of datasets that I work with now come from relational
            systems, specifically Microsoft SQL Server. I'm slowly adding JavaScript to my toolbox as well.
            I'm obsessed with logic, mathematics, philosophy, language, and computers (especially Linux). Here are some of my
            favorite quotes:
          </p>

            <p><em>"Be excellent to each other."</em> -Bill & Ted</p>

            <p><em>"If I have seen further than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."</em> -Sir Issac Newton</p>
            <p><em>"Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken."</em> -Tyler Durden</p>
            <p><em>"I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious."</em> -Michael Scott</p>
