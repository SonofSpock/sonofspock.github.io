            I'm currently working as a data analyst in Springfield, Missouri. I did my undergraduate and graduate work at
            the University of South Carolina, completing a master's degree in Higher Education in 2017. Probably the largest portion of my work deals with
            analyzing survey data and operations data. The rest is quality assurance, product testing, engineering support, and analytics
            application development. I'm always looking for ways to improve workflows and documentation. I use Python and the scientific 
            Python stack for most things, but I am also comfortable with R. Since most
            of our data is stored in relational databases, I also spend a fair amount of time in SQL. Recently, I've taken an interest in
            web development, and I've been tackling JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in my spare time. I'm obsessed with logic, mathematics, philosophy,
            and language. Here are some of my favorite quotes:
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p><em>"Be excellent to each other."</em> -Bill & Ted</p>
            <p><em>"The unexamined life is not worth living."</em> -Socrates</p>
            <p><em>"If I have seen further than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."</em> -Sir Issac Newton</p>
            <p><em>"Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken."</em> -Tyler Durden</p>
            <p><em>"I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious."</em> -Michael Scott</p>
            <p><em>"All you need is love."</em> -The Beatles</p>
            <p><em>"Be smart."</em> -My grandmother</p>
