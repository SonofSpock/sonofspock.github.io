        <h1>Simulating Retention Rates</h1>
<h6>How Can We Tell If an Institution is Improving?</h6>
<hr>
<p class="para_1">
    The retention rate at any given instiution will fluctuate over time. For
    example, the data in the plot below represent the retention rates from
    2005 to 2014 of an institution selected at random from the IPEDS Universe.
    We can clearly see that the rate falls and rises from year to year, but
    does that actually mean that it’s changing? It may not; the variations
    could simply be random chance. If we want to be serious about graduation
    rates, or retention rates, we need to think probabilistically.
</p>

<p>
  Let’s take the average of these data over the 10 year period: 72.6, and
  assume that this is a good approximation of the <em>true</em> graduation
  rate. After all, it’s all we really have for making such an approximation.
</p>
<p>
  Understand that the <em>true</em> graduation rate is really something that 
  is out of our reach in practice. Conceptually, it is simply the rate that 
  we would end up with, if we could admit and a very large number of classes 
  and subject them to the same educational experience. Although it isn’t 
  feasible to do this, we can simulate doing it.
</p>
<p>
  Student retention is a binomially distributed variable; a student
  either graduates or not. The retention rate of the class of students 
  is the proportion of the class retained, and its sampling distribution
  is approximately normally distributed. 
  With this information and the 10 year average rate, we can use <code>R</code> to
  simulate a large number of trials and analyze their distibution.

        trials, main = &quot;Distribution of Random Trials&quot;,<br>
        xlab = &quot;Retention Rate&quot;, ylab = &quot;Count&quot;) + <br>

  style="margin:3% 5% 2% 5%; width:90%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow: 4px 4px 8px grey;">  

<p>
  Just by looking at the histogram, we can see that values ranging from 70 to 75 
  are not really unusual observations. Although the decline in the retention 
  rate might have caused the administration on campus some anxiety, there is 
  really no need to worry. Statistically, these rates are still part of the same 
  distribution. In other words, the real rate hasn’t actually changed at all.
  The histogram is a good representation of this distribution, but a confidence 
  interval can give more precise boundaries.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
  > lower_est &lt;- quantile(trials, 0.005)<br>
  > upper_est &lt;- quantile(trials, 0.995)<br>
  > print(paste(lower_est, upper_est))<br>
  <br>
  [1] &quot;0.700 0.752&quot;
</div>


<p>
  On this campus, we would like to observe a rate greater than 75.2% because this 
  could be a sign of real improvement. On the other hand, a rate less than 70.0% could 
  be cause for concern. Still, there is a good deal of variance in this 
  distibution. It is probable that observations of the rate will continue to be 
  in flux. So, we should think probablisitically about graduation and retention rates. 
  This allows to have a method for detecting change in the rate, hopefully 
  improvement, and it gives us perspective when the observed rate fluctuates.
