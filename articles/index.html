        <hr>
        <p> Retention rates fluctuate from year to year on college campuses. Although we may be tempted to interpret an increase in the rate of retention as a sign of improvement or a decrease in  retention as a sign of decline, this may be inappropriate. We can expect a certain amount of variance in the retention rate even if institutional performance remains constant. This article explains why. </p>
