      <p>
        I built this page as a showcase of basic HTML and CSS features. I wanted
        a reference for stuff that I will frequently have to do to create
        websites. This seemed like a good idea. Now, all the stuff I need to
        know will be in one place!      
      </p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>

      <p>HTML has three separate types of lists built into it.</p>

      <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
      <p>
        These lists use bullet points because there's no particular order
        associated with them. You can also nests a list inside of another
        list to make a hierarchy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Fruit</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Apples</li>
          <li>Oranges</li>
          <li>Bananas</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Coffee</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
      <p>
        Ordered lists, on the other hand, use numbers to indicate that a
        particular sequence matters for the items in the list. These lists can
        also be nested within one another. Thankfully, HTML takes care of the
        numbering automatically.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 deg</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Flour</li>
          <li>Baking Soda</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Add wet ingredients, and mix until all lumps are gone</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into 9 in. baking pan, and bake for 30 mins.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Description Lists</h3>
      <p>
        This final type of list should be used when each element of the list has
        its own definition or description. For example, suppose you had a
        glossary or a list of terms.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Python</dt>
        <dd>
          A dynamically typed, interpreted, scripting language for general
          purpose computer programming. It has recently become popular for web
          development and for data science and analytics.
        </dd>
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>
          Another dynamically typed, interpreted language mostly used for
          client-side web development. Recently, however, with the development
          of NodeJS, its popularity as a server-side language has increased.
        </dd>
        <dt>R</dt>
        <dd>
          This is also a dynamically typed, interpreted language. It is mostly
          used for data science and analytics. It is very popular among 
          statisticians.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Built-in References</h2>
      <p>
        HTML offers a great set of tags for marking up blockquotes, inline
        quotes, abbreviations, and citations. The quote below is taken from
        Barrack Obama's inaugural address.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="http://obamaspeeches.com/">
        Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It
        has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer 
        leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. 
        Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things 
        - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, 
        who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and 
        freedom.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That text is offset from the rest of the text on the page becaues it
        is wrapped in <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags. But not all quotes
        are long enough or significant enough to warrant a blockquote. For these
        inline quotes we use the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> tag. Both have a
        <code>cite</code> attribute.
      </p>

      <h2>Forms</h2>
      <form>
        <div>
          <label for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="User"><br>
          <textarea id="message" name="UserMessage"></textarea><br>
          <button type="reset">Reset</button>
        </div>
      </form>

      <p>
        Here's another paragraph that should explain some more stuff about the
        form. As I said, the form doesn't do anything so there is really nothing
        to explain at this point.
      </p>
