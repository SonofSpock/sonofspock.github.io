        <h1>Jay's HTML & CSS Reference Page</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      I built this page as a showcase of basic HTML and CSS features. I wanted
      a reference for stuff that I will frequently have to do to create
      websites. This seemed like a good idea. Now, all the stuff I need to
      know will be in one place!      
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>HTML has three separate types of lists built into it.</p>

    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>
      These lists use bullet points because there's no particular order
      associated with them. You can also nests a list inside of another
      list to make a hierarchy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Fruit</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Oranges</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
    <p>
      Ordered lists, on the other hand, use numbers to indicate that a
      particular sequence matters for the items in the list. These lists can
      also be nested within one another. Thankfully, HTML takes care of the
      numbering automatically.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 deg</li>
      <li>Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Add wet ingredients, and mix until all lumps are gone</li>
      <li>Pour evenly into 9 in. baking pan, and bake for 30 mins.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description Lists</h3>
    <p>
      This final type of list should be used when each element of the list has
      its own definition or description. For example, suppose you had a
      glossary or a list of terms.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Python</dt>
      <dd>
        A dynamically typed, interpreted, scripting language for general
        purpose computer programming. It has recently become popular for web
        development and for data science and analytics.
      </dd>
      <dt>JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>
        Another dynamically typed, interpreted language mostly used for
        client-side web development. Recently, however, with the development
        of NodeJS, its popularity as a server-side language has increased.
      </dd>
      <dt>R</dt>
      <dd>
        This is also a dynamically typed, interpreted language. It is mostly
        used for data science and analytics. It is very popular among 
        statisticians.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Built-in References</h2>
    <p>
      HTML offers a great set of tags for marking up blockquotes, inline
      quotes, abbreviations, and citations. The quote below is taken from
      Barrack Obama's inaugural address.
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://obamaspeeches.com/">
      Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It
      has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer 
      leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. 
      Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things 
      - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, 
      who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and 
      freedom.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That text is offset from the rest of the text on the page becaues it
      is wrapped in <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags. But not all quotes
      are long enough or significant enough to warrant a blockquote. For these
      inline quotes we use the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> tag. Both have a
      <code>cite</code> attribute.
    </p>

    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="User"><br>
        <textarea id="message" name="UserMessage"></textarea><br>
        <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    <p>
      Here's another paragraph that should explain some more stuff about the
      form. As I said, the form doesn't do anything so there is really nothing
      to explain at this point.
