        <h1>Jay's HTML & CSS Reference Page</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      I built this page as a showcase of basic HTML and CSS features. I wanted
      a reference for stuff that I will frequently have to do to create
      websites. This seemed like a good idea. Now, all the stuff I need to
      know will be in one place!      
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>HTML has three separate types of lists built into it.</p>

    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>
      These lists use bullet points because there's no particular order
      associated with them. You can also nests a list inside of another
      list to make a hierarchy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Fruit</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Oranges</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
    <p>
      Ordered lists, on the other hand, use numbers to indicate that a
      particular sequence matters for the items in the list. These lists can
      also be nested within one another. Thankfully, HTML takes care of the
      numbering automatically.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 deg</li>
      <li>Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Add wet ingredients, and mix until all lumps are gone</li>
      <li>Pour evenly into 9 in. baking pan, and bake for 30 mins.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="User"><br>
        <textarea id="message" name="UserMessage"></textarea><br>
        <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    <p>
      Here's another paragraph that should explain some more stuff about the
      form. As I said, the form doesn't do anything so there is really nothing
      to explain at this point.
