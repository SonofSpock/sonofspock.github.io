Part of the purpose of the site is to market myself as an Educational
Researcher. To that end, it is necessary that I demonstrate my technical
prowess, because I have no technical degree or certifaction that speaks
to my technical ability. As a result, future employers have no reason
to believe that I am actually qualified to do the work that I do. As a
matter of fact, I am currently underqualified to do my current job, but
we'll overlook that detail for now. So these posts will showcase these
skills without me needing to go back to earn another degree. It will also
serve to hold me accountable to my own personal development. It will
make me happy. It will help preserve me, and enable me to more fully
understand myself.
