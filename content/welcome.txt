Greetings visitors,

I am a philosopher at my core. I am passionate about education, and I
think computers are really cool. This is my website; it combines all of
these things. I try to be clear and concise not only to postpone
the demise of English as long as possible, but also because I don't
think that  verbosity does anyone any good.

Typically, I find that ideas which require long-winded explanations are
either not yet well-formed or are intentionally meant to confuse an
audience or disguise the meaning of ideas. The first case is bad
enough because the end result is an utter waste of everyone's time. The
second case is probably the product of ill-intentions. It isn't my
intention to waste your time or to corrupt you.

In any case, we are all only given so much time, and each of us spends
it how we choose. This is why I call you visitors. You are a visitor to
the site, but in a more profound, existential sense, you are a visitor
to this world just like me. We arrived through no fault of own, and from
day one are fated to depart.

I chose to spend some of my time constructing this site because I
enjoy doing it. If you benefit from it, that's good. If not, that's ok
too. Regardless of who you are or how much time you have left, I hope
you spend it doing what you enjoy most.

Sincerely,
JPH
